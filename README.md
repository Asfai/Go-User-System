# Golang User System

User System created with Golang. It's really fun with Golang. Don't believe me? Go ahead & use it by yourself!! 👻🤝👀

# Updated version
Visit [this](https://github.com/yTakkar/Go-React-User-System) for single-page user-system with React & Golang!!

# Usage
1. Open PHPMyAdmin, create a db & import `db.sql`.
2. Go to `models/db.go` & change DB connection settings.
3. My root folder name is `Go-User-System`, if yours is different then go ahead & change it as it used for imports. It can be done easily by searching the whole project.
4. Enjoy!!
